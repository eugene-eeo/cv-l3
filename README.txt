Stereo Vision (njzj22)
======================

Put coco.names, yolov3.cfg, yolo.weights in the same directory.

You might need to modify the assignment.py and assignment_sparse_stereo.py files to point to the correct directory.

For dense stereo, run:

    $ python ./assignment.py

Sparse stereo:

    $ python ./assignment_sparse_stereo.py
